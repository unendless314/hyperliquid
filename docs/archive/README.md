# Archived Docs

This folder preserves the original product and system design documents for reference.

## Files
- PRD.md: Original product requirements (v1.2)
- SYSTEM_DESIGN.md: Original technical specification (v1.2)

## Why archived
We are replacing these with a modular, production-focused documentation set that separates
system architecture, module specs, and cross-module contracts. The archived files remain
available for historical context and design intent, but they are no longer the primary source
of truth.
